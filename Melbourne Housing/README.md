# Melbourne Property Price from 2016-2018

I am analysing melbourne houseing from 2016-2018. In hope to see any trend in Melbourne housing market when planning to buy property.

I check if distance from CBD affect housing, Does number of rooms affect the price and average price of houses in Melbourne.

I did some visualization in Tableau https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/arief.darmawan7176/viz/Melbournehousepricefrom2016-2018/Dashboard1 if anyone interested in viewing the.
