# Covid19 Project

Hello, this is my data analysis project about Covid-19. I used Microsoft SQL Server to find the death rate, infection rate as well as vaccination rate of Covid-19 across multiple countries.
The data was taken from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.

I did some visualisation on death rate and infection rate. I posted this on my tableau dashboard which can be found at
